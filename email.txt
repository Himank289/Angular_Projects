Subject: Clarification Regarding Furniture Dispatch Enrollment

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I hope this email finds you well.

I am writing to follow up on my previous correspondence regarding the furniture dispatch. Upon reviewing my records, I realized that I did not initially opt for the dispatch in my first email. However, I would like to confirm whether my name has now been enrolled for the dispatch as per my second email.

Could you please provide clarification on whether the dispatch is scheduled for my order?

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I appreciate your assistance in resolving this.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
